### Key Achievements

#### Shared Development Framework
Inspired by practices at larger mobile studios, I designed and implemented a shared iOS library of rigorously documented and unit-tested components to accelerate feature delivery across multiple projects. This framework standardized patterns, reduced duplication, lowered development costs, and improved time-to-market while maintaining quality.

- Conducted R&D on emerging iOS capabilities and architectural patterns.
- Established team processes and collaboration tools to improve communication with product management and UX design.
- Provided 1:1 mentorship, code reviews, and feedback to support growth and performance.
- Organized recurring lunch-and-learn sessions to promote knowledge sharing and continuous learning.
