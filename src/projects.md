## Poka for visionOS

I independently conceived, designed, and delivered a visionOS-native application that pushed the limits of the SDK and showcased a compelling spatial experience. The work received strong feedback from Apple, clearly differentiating Poka from teams performing simple ports and contributing to our selection for a Vision Pro Dev Kit.

At the U.S. launch of Apple Vision Pro, Poka was the first Connected Worker Platform operating on the device, establishing an early leadership position in spatial computing for the enterprise.

## Poka API Generator

I designed and built an in-house framework that enables the iOS team to automatically generates the network layer for Poka’s iOS apps to communicate with our platform. Instead of hand-writing repetitive code, the team defines each API in a simple, human-readable way, and the framework creates the rest. This reduced boilerplate, improved consistency, and let developers focus on delivering features.

While Apple has since released an OpenAPI code generator, our solution still continues to provide a better value. It is tightly integrated with Poka’s security requirements, coding standards, and API designs, making it easier and safer to use in our environment than a generic tool. 

## Poka Sri-Lankan Expansion

I led the onboarding and integration of a team of software developers in Sri Lanka, ensuring a smooth transition and alignment with our company’s policies, culture, and quality standards.

Built a collaborative culture by bridging cultural differences and promoting mutual understanding, which improved teamwork and overall performance.

Designed and delivered a tailored training program based on the team’s skills and needs, speeding up their ramp-up and enabling meaningful contributions sooner.
