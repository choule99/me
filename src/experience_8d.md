- Title: Back-End *Java* Developer (2009); *iOS* Developer (2010–2013)
- Dates: October 2009 – October 2013

### Responsibilities

- Began as a back-end *Java* developer on the Solstice bike-sharing application suite.
- Transitioned to the *iOS* team when a position opened, driven by a desire to learn new technologies, adopt modern development paradigms, and contribute to the emerging mobile ecosystem.
- As an *iOS* developer, I maintained the Spotcycle application (a generic bike-sharing app) and developed the Solstice *iOS* application, a white-label product within the Solstice suite.

### Key Challenges

At the time, bike-sharing systems such as Bixi were nascent, and we were effectively pioneering a new product category. Smartphones were still early in adoption, public Wi‑Fi was scarce, and cellular networks were expensive and often slow, so we needed solutions that operated reliably across an entire city under variable connectivity conditions.

Rapid user growth necessitated continuous optimization of existing features, expedited delivery of new capabilities, and a sustained cadence of innovation. As the platform expanded internationally, we engineered market-specific functionality to support high-profile deployments in cities such as London and New York City.
