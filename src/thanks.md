After two decades in the industry, I’ve learned that software development is a team endeavor—one that thrives on working alongside outstanding professionals, communicating effectively, collaborating closely, and building great software every day.

I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to a select group of colleagues with whom I had the privilege of working; their talent, support, and camaraderie made the long hours both meaningful and rewarding.
