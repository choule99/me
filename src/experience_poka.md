- Title: Lead iOS Developer, Lead visionOS Developer, Mobile Architect
- Dates: September 2021 â€“ Present

### Key Achievements

#### Team Productivity

Transformed the existing iOS team (8 developers including myself) into a high-performing unit by building internal tools and reusable libraries that reduced development time, improved code quality, and enabled engineers to focus on feature delivery. These initiatives standardized best practices, accelerated onboarding, and significantly increased throughput.

#### visionOS Application

Initially tasked with porting the existing iOS app to visionOS for an Apple Partner Relations review to obtain a Vision Pro Developer Kit. While the port functioned (with notable SDK limitations), it did not meet the desired product experience. In parallel, independently designed and built a new visionOS-native application to push the boundaries of the SDK. This new application received strong feedback from Apple, standing out among teams that had only performed minimal ports, resulting in Poka being awarded a Vision Pro Dev Kit. The app launched on day one of the visionOS App Store.

#### Sri Lankan Team Onboarding

Led the hiring, onboarding, and integration of a Sri Lankan iOS team (3 new developers):

- Designed a rigorous onboarding and training program with real-world examples and hands-on exercises.
- Supervised the onboarding process through code reviews, technical guidance, and Q&A.
- Provided targeted coaching to the local lead to align practices and standards.

The team is now a productive, ongoing contributor to the iOS codebase and broader engineering initiatives.

### Responsibilities

Led the iOS team across multiple applications and initiatives throughout the *SDLC*:

- Conducted R&D on iOS and visionOS capabilities, architectures, and patterns.
- Established clear collaboration workflows and tools with Product Management and UX Design.
- Provided 1:1 mentorship, code reviews, and career-development guidance.
- Organized recurring lunch-and-learn sessions to foster continuous learning and knowledge sharing.
- Built internal developer tools and templates to boost productivity and consistency.
