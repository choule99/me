### Key Achievement

**Migration Architecture** — Libra project — migrated legacy mainframe systems to Java services under financial compliance requirements within a globally distributed team (New York, Budapest, Tokyo, Vancouver).

### The Challenge

As a financial institution, Morgan Stanley enforced stringent security, reliability, and compliance requirements. All technology selections required approval from the Enterprise Architecture group based in New York.

The project was executed by a **globally distributed team—New York, Budapest, Tokyo, and Vancouver**—demanding careful coordination across time zones and cultures, particularly notable given the tooling and practices of the mid-2000s.

The Libra project was an enterprise initiative to migrate critical functionality from IBM z/OS mainframes to Linux-based services. The work was high-stakes: most components were mission-critical and could not tolerate performance regressions or functional deviations. Success required thorough analysis, careful planning, and disciplined engineering practices executed on a weekly cadence.

### Responsibilities

- Assigned to the Morgan Stanley account, contributing to the Libra project
- Migrated business logic from COBOL on z/OS to Java services running on Linux with IBM Db2
- Implemented and optimized integration patterns for high-throughput, reliable processing
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams to ensure adherence to enterprise security and compliance standards
