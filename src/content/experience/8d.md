### Key Achievements

**System Architecture** — Started on backend Java team for the Solstice bike-sharing suite; transitioned to iOS bringing backend expertise that bridged system architecture across layers.

**Scalability Solutions** — Engineered solutions for challenging connectivity and performance constraints in London and NYC deployments, where smartphones were early in adoption and cellular networks were expensive and slow.

**AR Innovation** — Pioneered first-ever Augmented Reality bike-sharing finder combining live camera feed with Core Location data.

**International Deployment** — Developed Spotcycle and Solstice apps, deployed successfully in London and New York City.

### The Challenge

At the time, bike-sharing systems such as Bixi were nascent, and we were effectively pioneering a new product category. Smartphones were still early in adoption, public Wi-Fi was scarce, and cellular networks were expensive and often slow — we needed solutions that operated reliably across an entire city under variable connectivity conditions.

Rapid user growth necessitated continuous optimization of existing features, expedited delivery of new capabilities, and a sustained cadence of innovation. As the platform expanded internationally, we engineered market-specific functionality to support high-profile deployments.

### Responsibilities

- Began as a back-end Java developer on the Solstice bike-sharing application suite
- Transitioned to the iOS team, bringing backend expertise to mobile and expanding full-stack capabilities
- Built and evolved the Spotcycle application (generic bike-sharing app) and Solstice iOS application (white-label product)
- Implemented augmented reality features combining live camera with geospatial data
