### Responsibilities

- Began as a back-end Java developer on the Solstice bike-sharing application suite
- Transitioned to the iOS team when a position opened, bringing backend expertise to mobile and expanding full-stack capabilities across the product suite
- Maintained the Spotcycle application (a generic bike-sharing app) and developed the Solstice iOS application, a white-label product within the Solstice suite
- Implemented the first-ever Augmented Reality bike-sharing finder by combining the live camera with Core Location

### The Challenge

At the time, bike-sharing systems such as Bixi were nascent, and we were effectively pioneering a new product category. Smartphones were still early in adoption, public Wi-Fi was scarce, and cellular networks were expensive and often slow—we needed solutions that operated reliably across an entire city under variable connectivity conditions.

Rapid user growth necessitated continuous optimization of existing features, expedited delivery of new capabilities, and a sustained cadence of innovation. As the platform expanded internationally, we engineered market-specific functionality to support high-profile deployments in cities such as **London** and **New York City**.
