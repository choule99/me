### The Challenge

This was my first full-time professional role, where I focused on building strong engineering fundamentals—adopting professional practices, learning from mentorship, and developing production-grade software in a collaborative environment.

I graduated in mid-2003 during a difficult job market following the dot-com bubble burst. Many talented graduates struggled to find roles. I was one of the fortunate few hired after my internship, joining Mediagrif as a Java developer for a suite of e-commerce sites.

That first role was a crash course in becoming a professional engineer. School provided foundations, but the workplace taught me how to deliver production-grade software, collaborate effectively, and build good engineering habits. I was especially lucky to have mentors who shaped my early career; their guidance made me a better developer, and I remain grateful for their mentorship.
