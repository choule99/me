The iOS application serves 18,000 daily active users and processes over 240,000 sessions per day, supported by a mature, production-grade codebase of 450,000 lines of Swift and 55,000 lines of legacy Objective-C, while consistently maintaining a crash-free session rate above 99.99%.

### Key Achievements

**Team Productivity** — Transformed the iOS team (8 developers) into a high-performing unit by building internal tools and reusable libraries that reduced development time, improved code quality, and enabled engineers to focus on feature delivery. These initiatives standardized best practices, accelerated onboarding, and significantly increased throughput.

**visionOS Application** — Initially tasked with porting the existing iOS app to visionOS for an Apple Partner Relations review. While the port functioned, it did not meet the desired product experience. In parallel, independently designed and built a new visionOS-native application that pushed the boundaries of the SDK. This work received strong feedback from Apple, standing out among teams that had only performed minimal ports, resulting in Poka being awarded a Vision Pro Dev Kit. The app launched on day one of the visionOS App Store.

**Test Coverage Initiative** — Led an initiative that increased code coverage from approximately 30% to 60% over four years by adding tests alongside refactors to modern technologies and enforcing steady, incremental growth in coverage.

**Sri Lankan Team Onboarding** — Led the hiring, onboarding, and integration of a Sri Lankan iOS team (3 developers). Designed a rigorous onboarding and training program with real-world examples and hands-on exercises. Supervised through code reviews, technical guidance, and Q&A. The team is now a productive, ongoing contributor to the iOS codebase.
