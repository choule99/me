description: "Technical architect for a connected worker platform serving 200,000+ DAU. Leading architectural evolution, team transformation, and cross-functional alignment across a 450K-line codebase."
---

Poka is a connected worker platform with over 200,000 daily active users that helps manufacturers improve productivity and knowledge sharing on the factory floor. The iOS application is supported by a mature, production-grade codebase of 450,000 lines of Swift and 55,000 lines of legacy Objective-C, while consistently maintaining a crash-free session rate above 99.999%.

### Key Achievements

**Architecture Leadership** — Introduced internal tools, reusable libraries, and standardized practices that transformed an 8-person iOS team into a high-performing unit. These initiatives standardized best practices, accelerated onboarding, and significantly increased throughput — raising stability to 99.999% crash-free.

**visionOS Innovation** — Led end-to-end development of the 1st industrial solution on the visionOS App Store. Initially tasked with porting the existing iOS app, I independently designed and built a visionOS-native application that pushed SDK boundaries. Following a demo to Apple, Poka secured a Vision Pro Dev Kit.

**Team Scaling** — Onboarded 20 developers internationally with custom training curriculum and cross-timezone code reviews — operational within 3 months. Fostered collaborative culture by bridging cultural gaps and promoting mutual understanding.

**Quality Engineering** — Increased test coverage from 30% to 60% over four years through incremental testing alongside architectural modernization and refactors to modern technologies.

**CI/CD Architecture** — Automated App Store deployments end-to-end; increased release cadence from 1/week to 4/day and improved CI build speeds by 50% through MacStadium migration.

### Responsibilities

- Conducted R&D on iOS and visionOS capabilities, architectures, and patterns
- Bridged gaps between engineering, Product Management, and UX Design; established collaboration workflows aligning technical solutions with business goals
- Provided 1:1 mentorship, code reviews, and career-development guidance
- Organized recurring lunch-and-learn sessions to foster continuous learning
- Built internal developer tools and templates to boost productivity and consistency
- Integrated AI-assisted tools (Claude, Warp) into the team workflow, reducing development time by 10%
