Poka is a connected worker platform with over 200,000 daily active users that helps manufacturers improve productivity and knowledge sharing on the factory floor. The iOS application is supported by a mature, production-grade codebase of 450,000 lines of Swift and 55,000 lines of legacy Objective-C, while consistently maintaining a crash-free session rate above 99.999%.

### Key Achievements

**Team Productivity** — Transformed the iOS team (8 developers) into a high-performing unit by building internal tools and reusable libraries that reduced development time, improved code quality, and enabled engineers to focus on feature delivery. These initiatives standardized best practices, accelerated onboarding, and significantly increased throughput. As a result, the application's crash-free session rate increased to 99.999%.

**visionOS Application** — Initially tasked with porting the existing iOS app to visionOS for an Apple Partner Relations review. While the port functioned, it did not meet the desired product experience. In parallel, independently designed and built a new visionOS-native application that pushed the boundaries of the SDK. Following a demo to Apple, Poka secured a Vision Pro Dev Kit. The app launched on day one of the visionOS App Store.

**Test Coverage Initiative** — Led an initiative that increased code coverage from approximately 30% to 60% over four years by adding tests alongside refactors to modern technologies and enforcing steady, incremental growth in coverage.

**Sri Lankan Team Onboarding** — Led the hiring, onboarding, and integration of a team of 20 Sri Lankan developers. Designed a detailed training curriculum tailored to the unique needs and skills of the developers, enabling them to get up to speed within 3 months of joining Poka. Fostered a collaborative work environment by bridging cultural gaps and promoting mutual understanding, which improved team dynamics and performance.
