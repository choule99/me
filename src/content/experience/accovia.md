### Key Achievement

**Platform Architecture** — Rebuilt Ibiza travel platform with Java/Spring/Hibernate after critical client recovery — performance optimization and service orchestration. Delivered on time and on budget.

### The Challenge

The Ibiza Project emerged from a critical situation in which a major client, having commissioned a modernized version of Accovia's flagship Logitours product, initiated legal action due to performance and reliability issues in the delivered software. Under new leadership, Accovia resolved the dispute and committed to delivering a replacement platform that was fast, reliable, and required no additional investment from the client.

The mandate was ambitious: rebuild the platform on a modern technology stack under tight time, budget, and staffing constraints. Through disciplined architecture, focused scope, and rigorous engineering practices, **the team delivered the project on time and on budget**. I consider myself fortunate to have been part of that team.

### Responsibilities

- Assigned to the Architecture Team to contribute to the core platform
- Designed and implemented back-end services and integration components using Java, Spring, and Hibernate
- Collaborated on performance optimization, reliability improvements, and service orchestration within a distributed system
- Supported build automation and continuous integration practices
