    "goals.lookingFor.p1": "I am seeking a company, team, or product to which I can make a long-term commitment. After many years in consulting (prior to Poka), I had the opportunity to work continuously on a single product, enabling durable technical decisions that would be impractical in short engagements.",
    "goals.lookingFor.p2": "The architectural mindset required for a multi-year project is entirely different from short-term engagements — the types of decisions whose impact becomes evident over months or even years.",
    "goals.approach": "How I Work",
    "goals.approach.p1": "I engage early with product discovery and design to translate user needs and business goals into clear, testable requirements — partnering with product managers and designers to balance technical feasibility, UX quality, and time-to-value. I invest heavily in mentorship, having guided junior engineers into independent contributors and scaled teams across time zones.",

    "tech.codeCoverage": "Code Coverage",
    "tech.codeCoverageDesc": "There's no one-size-fits-all answer. Generally, pursuing 100% has diminishing returns. In my experience, ~75% test coverage usually provides strong stability at a balanced cost.",

    "education.p2": "For context, Quebec's Computer Science Technology program is a three-year, practice-oriented college diploma focused on programming and applied computing. It is broadly comparable to an associate degree in the United States.",
    "education.p3": "I initially planned to pursue a bachelor's degree after completing Cegep. However, during my 10-week internship, I learned so much more in practical situations than in the preceding three years, leading me to shift my mindset: I would pursue a bachelor's degree if it ever became necessary for my career. To date, it has not been a limiting factor.",

    "story.earlyYears": "Early Years",
    "story.earlyYearsP1": "Like many kids of the '80s, my journey with computers began with games. I was fortunate to grow up in a family where technology was part of everyday life, so I had access to game consoles and computers from an early age.",
    "story.earlyYearsP2": "I have vivid memories of playing on the ColecoVision, Atari 2600, NES, and SNES, and later discovering adventures like King's Quest and Space Quest on my dad's computer. My father tried to introduce me to programming back then, but I was more interested in playing than coding - and at seven or eight years old, I was probably a bit too young to fully appreciate it.",
    "story.internet": "Meeting the Internet",
    "story.internetP1": "I had early access to the internet thanks to my mother's university account, which meant learning the ropes over a very slow dial-up connection. I wasn't yet focused on programming, but the internet opened the door to something I didn't realize I needed: online gaming.",
    "story.internetP2": "I spent countless hours playing cutting-edge titles of the time, eventually diving deep into games like Doom, Quake, Diablo, StarCraft, and Baldur's Gate.",
    "story.bug": "Catching the Programming Bug",
    "story.bugP1": "In high school, I switched from music to a computing course. While I enjoyed guitar, I'd hit a plateau and was eager for a new challenge. Given my talent with computers, I thought the class would be easy; instead, it became transformative.",
    "story.bugP2": "A teacher recognized my potential and gave me more ambitious assignments. Since I loved computer games, my assignments usually gravitated toward making my own rudimentary games. I became a fixture in the computer lab: writing code, testing my games, helping classmates, and trading tips with other motivated students. I was a total computer nerd, and I loved it.",
    "story.college": "College",
    "story.collegeP1": "From there, the choice was obvious: I wanted to be a software developer. I enrolled in the Computer Science Technology program at Cegep Edouard-Montpetit and never looked back.",
    "story.collegeP2": "Yes, I trained in C/C++, SQL, and other technologies (many of which are now obsolete), but the most valuable takeaway was:",
    "story.collegeQuote": "\"There is always something to learn, always something to discover, and to maintain that edge, you need to practice constantly.\"",
    "story.internship": "Internship / First Job",
    "story.internshipP1": "I graduated in mid-2003 during a difficult job market following the dot-com bubble burst. Many talented graduates struggled to find roles. I was one of the fortunate few hired after my internship, joining Mediagrif as a Java developer for a suite of e-commerce sites.",
    "story.internshipP2": "That first role was a crash course in becoming a professional engineer. School provided foundations, but the workplace taught me how to deliver production-grade software, collaborate effectively, and build good engineering habits. I was especially lucky to have mentors who shaped my early career; their guidance made me a better developer, and I remain grateful for their mentorship.",
    "story.expanding": "Expanding Beyond Backend",
    "story.expandingP1": "For the first six years of my career, I worked as a back-end Java developer, using technologies like J2EE, Spring Framework, Hibernate, Apache ActiveMQ, and more. I built strong foundations in enterprise architecture, but I was eager to expand my capabilities into new domains.",
    "story.expandingP2": "When Apple released the iPhone and opened up the iOS SDK, I embraced the opportunity to explore something new. I had already switched to a Mac at home, so installing Xcode and learning Objective-C was an accessible next step - though it required a major mindset shift. After years of Java's garbage collection, returning to manual memory management felt like a step backward.",
    "story.expandingP3": "Developing for iOS 2/3 came with real constraints: no ARC, no storyboards, no Auto Layout - just plain x/y positioning, no blocks (closures), extensive use of pointers, limited device performance, and no readily available crash reporting. It truly felt like a new frontier.",
    "story.since": "The Story Since Then",
    "story.sinceP1": "Since then, I have built full-stack expertise across backend services, web applications, and mobile platforms. As a software architect at Spiria, I led engagements spanning the entire stack — from Spring-based backends and Angular frontends to native iOS and Android clients. This breadth has given me the architectural perspective to design systems end-to-end and the hands-on skills to contribute at every layer.",

    // Thanks
    "thanks.badge": "Special Thanks",
    "thanks.p1": "After two decades in the industry, I've learned that software development is a team endeavor - one that thrives on working alongside outstanding professionals, communicating effectively, collaborating closely, and building great software every day.",
