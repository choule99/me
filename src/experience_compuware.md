## Compuware Montréal

Compuware Montréal was a consultancy division of Compuware Canada serving large-scale software development needs in the banking sector, most notably Morgan Stanley.

- Title: Java Consultant
- Dates: September 2005 – September 2007

### Responsibilities

- Assigned to the Morgan Stanley account, contributing to the Libra project.
- Migrated business logic from COBOL on z/OS to Java services running on Linux with IBM Db2.
- Implemented and optimized integration patterns for high-throughput, reliable processing.
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams to ensure adherence to enterprise security and compliance standards.

### Key Challenges

As a financial institution, Morgan Stanley enforced stringent security, reliability, and compliance requirements. All technology selections required approval from the Enterprise Architecture group based in New York. The project was executed by a globally distributed team—New York, Budapest, Tokyo, and Vancouver—demanding careful coordination across time zones and cultures, particularly notable given the tooling and practices of the mid-2000s.

### Projects

During my tenure at Compuware Montréal, I was dedicated to a single global banking client and contributed to multiple applications within the Libra project—an enterprise initiative to migrate critical functionality from IBM z/OS mainframes to Linux-based services.

The work was high-stakes: most components were mission-critical and could not tolerate performance regressions or functional deviations. Success required thorough analysis, careful planning, and disciplined engineering practices executed on a weekly cadence.
