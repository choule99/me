## Spoken & Written Languages

English & French (Native)

## Hobbies

Coding, Computer Gaming, Biking, Karate, Board Games, Role Playing Games, Chess, LLMs

## Locations

I prefer remote roles as they offer greater flexibility and eliminate commuting time. I am open to hybrid positions in downtown Montreal or on the South Shore of Montreal.

### Moving

I will **not** consider any position which requires me to move, I have aging parents that will need my support for their golden years.

## Open-Source vs Copyrighted Work

I am favorable to open-source software in general, I just did not have many opportunities to contribute in a meaningful way to such projects in my career beyond a bug report or a random patch file sent. I'd say that 99.99% of the code I did in my career is covered by some kind of copyright that prevents me from showcasing it.
