## Social Media Accounts

I do have social media accounts, but I consider these highly personal and irrelevant to my career, therefore I will not grant access to them under any circumstance. My [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/choule99/) is the only social media account that can be accessed publicly without my explicit consent.

## Hobbies

Coding, Computer Gaming, Biking, Karate, Board Games, Role Playing Games, Chess, LLMs

## Moving

I will **not** consider any position which requires me to move, I have aging parents that will need my support for their golden years.

## Open-Source vs Copyrighted Work

I am favorable to open-source software in general, I just did not have many opportunities to contribute in a meaningful way to such projects in my career beyond a bug report or a random patch file sent. I'd say that 99.99% of the code I did in my career is covered by some kind of copyright that prevents me from showcasing it.
