Welcome to my digital [CV](./files/CV.pdf), my name is [Claude Houle](mailto:claude.houle@gmail.com), I am a Montreal-based software developer with 20+ years of experience.

I started in enterprise *Java* back end (Mediagrif, Compuware/Morgan Stanley, Accovia) building distributed systems and core platforms, and eventually transitioned to iOS in 2010, then served as mobile architect and lead at Spiria and Appcom, creating shared frameworks, establishing CI/CD, and mentoring high-performing teams. 

Currently Lead iOS at Poka, elevating quality and productivity, pioneering visionOS development, and championing testing, tooling, and continuous learning.

Note: If by some random miracle you have arrived from somewhere else than LinkedIn, here is my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/choule99/)

Note: I find it very difficult for recruiters and interviewers to fully grasp who I am using the standard 2-page CV & a 30-minute phone screen combo. I hope this page will give you better insights into who I am, and what motivates me.
