Welcome to my digital [CV](./files/CV.pdf)! 

My name is [Claude Houle](mailto:claude.houle@gmail.com), I am a Montreal-based software developer with 20+ years of experience.

I started in enterprise *Java* back end (Mediagrif, Compuware/Morgan Stanley, Accovia) building distributed systems and core platforms, and eventually transitioned to *iOS* in 2010, then served as mobile architect and lead at Spiria and Appcom, creating shared frameworks, establishing CI/CD, and mentoring high-performing teams. 

Currently Lead *iOS* at Poka, elevating quality and productivity, pioneering *visionOS* development, and championing testing, tooling, and continuous learning.

<hr />

I personally find very difficult to go over 20+ years worth of experience only equiped with a 2-page [CV](./files/CV.pdf) and 30 minutes phone screen. This is my humble solution to the problem, I sincerely hope this page will give you better insights into who I am, and what motivates me.
