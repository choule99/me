I consider myself a technology enthusiast, and my goal is to develop software solutions that enhance the lives of end users through meticulously designed applications. I believe that mobile phones and tablets, particularly Apple's devices, serve as the ideal platforms for delivering such software.

I am committed to continuously refining my skills by exploring new patterns, paradigms, and technologies. My goal is to consistently enhance my capabilities as a developer, striving to improve upon my performance from the previous week or month.

I believe in engaging early with product discovery and design to translate user needs and business goals into clear, testable requirements. I enjoy partnering with product managers and designers to shape scope, validate assumptions with data and prototypes, and propose pragmatic, high‑impact solutions that balance technical feasibility, UX quality, and time‑to‑value. This product‑minded approach aligns engineering work with measurable outcomes and reduces risk through iterative delivery.

Additionally, I have been fortunate to receive mentorship from exceptional software developers early in my career. In the past 5 to 7 years, I have taken on the role of mentor myself, guiding the next generation of software engineers to enhance their skills and professionalism.

## What I'm looking for

I am seeking a company, team, or product to which I can make a long-term commitment. After many years in consulting (prior to Poka), I had the opportunity to work continuously on a single product, which enabled me to make durable technical decisions that would be impractical in short engagements. 

The mindset required by an architect for a multi-year project is entirely different than a project that last only for a couple of months, the types of decisions whose impact becomes evident over months or even years.
