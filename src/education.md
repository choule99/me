From September 2000 to May 2003, I completed the Computer Science Technology program at Cégep Édouard-Montpetit in Longueuil, Québec, Canada. The curriculum emphasized practical software development and systems fundamentals, covering C, C++, JavaScript, SQL, Linux, and Oracle Database, among other technologies relevant at the time.

For context, Québec’s Computer Science Technology program is a three-year, practice-oriented college diploma focused on programming and applied computing. It is broadly comparable to an associate degree in the United States.

I initially planned to pursue a bachelor’s degree after completing Cégep. However, during my 10-week internship, I learned so much more in practical situations than in the preceding three years, leading me to shift my mindset: I would pursue a bachelor’s degree if it ever became necessary for my career. To date, it has not been a limiting factor.
